# HNKO
This repository contains the code for the paper: Learning Hamiltonian neural Koopman operator and simultaneously sustaining and discovering conservation law.

## Requirements
Please download the packages in the **requirements.txt** file.


## How it works
The data of HNKO_ast is provided in the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4_n5GAD2jS-SqP-enf8S-5cI781qTZu/view?usp=sharing)


## Updated documents
The newly added directory **Model in replys** contains the reproduced python code of CNN-LSTM, Hamiltonian ODE graph networks (HOGN) and reservoir computing.
For a standard comparison with these models, we apply the model structures in [CNN-LSTM](https://github.com/ozancanozdemir/CNN-LSTM), [graph-neural-ode](https://github.com/jaketae/graph-neural-ode/tree/master), [RC](https://github.com/zhuqunxi/RC_Lorenz).

The **hnko_feature.py** documents in directory **threeboy** and **kepler** are used to discover the Hamiltonians.
